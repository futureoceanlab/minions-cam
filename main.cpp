 *   Minions-cam: program to run stereo pair on Minions floats
 *   May 12, 2020
 *   Authors: Junsu Jang, FOL/MIT
 *      Description: 
 *   
 *   Minions-cam is intended for Linux based embedded SBC to 
 *   control the stereo camera on Minions floats. 
 *   This firmware has three jobs: 
 *   
 *   1. Trigger images and strobe LEDs accordingly at specified 
 *      framerate
 * 
 *   2. Log relevant sensor data
 * 
 *   3. Save images accordingly once the camera has reached 
 *      below 20m 
 * 
 *   4. Synchronize time with the slave camera
 * 
 *   Jobs 1 and 2 are done by a timer interrupt, which toggles
 *   a flag. Inside the main loop, appropriate GPIO pins are
 *   toggled and sensor data is logged on a CSV file.
 * 
 *   Jobs 2 happens when the images arrive through the USB, images
 *   are saved along with the timestamp.
 * 
 *   Job 4 is processed in the main loop and requires another
 *   timer interrupt with 6 hour long interval.
